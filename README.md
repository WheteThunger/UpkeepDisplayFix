This plugin fixes a display bug where the Tool Cupboard UI shows an incorrect protection period and resource requirement if the `decay.scale` convar is not `1.0`. This bug exists because `decay.scale` not only affects the rate at which unprotected buildings decay, but also the rate at which upkeep resources are consumed, even though the UI does not indicate this.

**Tip:** If you don't want `decay.scale` to alter the rate that upkeep resources are consumed, you can compensate for it by scaling the value of `decay.upkeep_period_minutes` by the value of `decay.scale`. For example, if you have `decay.scale 3.0` and `decay.upkeep_period_minutes 1440`, change `decay.upkeep_period_minutes` to `4320` to cause upkeep resources to be consumed at the same rate as if you had `decay.scale 1.0`. This plugin is still needed to fix the display since the Tool Cupboard UI factors in `upkeep_period_minutes`.
