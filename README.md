This plugin fixes a bug where the Tool Cupboard UI displays an incorrect amount of resources and protection period if the `decay.scale` convar is not `1.0`. This bug happens because `decay.scale` not only affects the rate at which unprotected buildings decay, but also the rate at which upkeep resources are consumed, even though the UI does not display this. This plugin fixes the display issue by properly taking into account the value of `decay.scale`.

Note: If you don't want `decay.scale` to alter the rate that upkeep resources are consumed, you can compensate for it by scaling the value of `decay.upkeep_period_minutes` by the value of `decay.scale`. For example, if you have `decay.scale 3.0` and `decay.upkeep_period_minutes 1440`, change `decay.upkeep_period_minutes` to `4320` to cause upkeep resources to be consumed at the same rate as if you had `decay.scale 1.0`. This plugin is still needed to fix the display since the Tool Cupboard UI takes into account the value of `upkeep_period_minutes`.
