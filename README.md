This plugin fixes a display bug where the Tool Cupboard UI shows an incorrect protection period and resource requirement if the `decay.scale` convar is not `1.0`. This bug exists because `decay.scale` not only affects the rate at which unprotected buildings decay, but also the rate at which upkeep resources are consumed, even though the UI does not indicate this.

**Tip:** If you don't want `decay.scale` to alter the rate that upkeep resources are consumed, you can compensate for it by scaling the value of `decay.upkeep_period_minutes` by the value of `decay.scale`. For example, if you have `decay.scale 3.0` and `decay.upkeep_period_minutes 1440`, change `decay.upkeep_period_minutes` to `4320` to cause upkeep resources to be consumed at the same rate as if you had `decay.scale 1.0`. This plugin is still needed to fix the display.

**Note:** When using `decay.scale 0`, the Tool Cupboard loot panel will show as decaying if you don't have at least one of each resource type. If you have at least one of each required resource, this plugin will force a display of 30 days (for lack of a more obvious number since it's infinite).
